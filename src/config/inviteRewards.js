// inviteRewards.js — CC for inviting people to Chaos (services/inviteRewardService.js).
//
// A member who invites someone gets `reward` CC once the invited member has reached level `level`,
// sent at least `minMessages` chat messages (and, when `minStayDays` is above 0, has been in the server that
// many days). An invite doesn't count when the invited
// account is younger than `minAccountAgeDays` days (fake/alt accounts), when the member was in the
// server before (a rejoin), when they invited themselves, or when the invited member leaves before
// the reward is paid. The reward is a fixed amount: the CC event multiplier doesn't apply.
//
// Paid invites count towards the invite roles below; a member only keeps the role of their highest tier.

// The Chaos server and its welcome channel (voidWelcome.js posts the welcome there too).
