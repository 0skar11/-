// The games moved to a separate games bot, so they are OFF by default. Nothing was deleted: every
// game file is still in the repo (commands/Games, commands/Fun, services/games, the panel buttons)
// and `GAMES_ENABLED=true` in the environment brings all of it back after a restart.
//
// What stays on either way is the CC system: `daily`, `cc`, `cctop`, the live Top CC board and
// the CC API the games bot uses to pay players (src/services/cc/ccApi.js).
//
// While the games are off:
//   • the game commands below are not loaded, not registered as slash commands and not in `help`;
//   • the games channel is open again (no "games only" deleting), so the games bot can work there;
//   • old games panel buttons answer that the games moved.
