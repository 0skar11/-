// bourse.js — the CC bourse (البورصة): 8 things members buy with CC and sell back later at the
// price of the hour. Run by src/services/cc/bourseService.js, commands in src/commands/Games/bourse.js
// (`اسعار`، `استثمار 3`، `بيع 3`، `ممتلكاتي`).
//
// Prices change at the start of every hour (5:00, 6:00, 7:00...). Each hour an asset moves up or down
// by a random amount of at most `maxMovePercent` (10%) of its last price (the owner's rule: never
// more than 10% in one update), and never leaves [min, max]. Near a limit the move leans back towards
// the middle so the price doesn't stick to it, and a price never lands on a limit itself, so prices
// always look random (1,325, not 2,000).
//
// Demand: every member who bought an asset during the hour (more than they sold) pushes its next
// move up by `demand.perBuyerPercent`, every net seller pushes it down, together at most
// `demand.maxPercent` (the whole move still stays within `maxMovePercent`). When 20 or more pieces
// were bought in the hour (net of sales), the price is sure to go up at the next update, by
// `demand.perUnitPercent` per piece (see `guaranteedRiseUnits` below), with no random part. Buying also lifts the asset's ceiling above `max` (by the same percent, up to
// `demand.maxRaisePercent`); an hour with no buying demand lowers it again by
// `demand.raiseDecayPercent`, so the price comes back to its normal range by itself.
//
// Asset fields: id (lowercase, stays the same forever: it is the key in members' holdings), name,
// emoji, min, max, start and volatility (the very first price is random around `start`, up to
// `volatility` away; after that every hour moves at most `maxMovePercent`).
